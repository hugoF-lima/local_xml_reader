# Batch XML Invoice Automation (Python RPA)
Python-based RPA solution developed to automate invoice emission by replacing a manual PDF-based workflow with structured XML batch processing.

The system parses XML invoice data, extracts relevant fields, automates interaction with an external invoice management system, and updates structured Excel reports.

This reduced invoice processing time from **90 minutes to 40 minutes per 100 invoices (55% reduction / 2.25× throughput increase)**.
